#you can use this function to implement your inverse kinematic equations to calculate a RPM value to give the robot. Essentially your xd (x dot a.k.a x velocity) will be the value you pass in to move the robot in the x direction in meters per second. The same applies to yd. thetad will be your orientation and is in radians, for example 3.14 would be half a rotation a second.
